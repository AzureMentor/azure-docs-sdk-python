    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This should be used as quick start developer experience. For production purposes, use 
    > [ADAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-python) or your own credentials system.
    > Any change to your CLI configuration will impact the SDK execution.

    The SDK is able to create a client using your CLI active subscription.

    To define active credentials, use [az login](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
    Default subscription ID is either the only one you have, or you can define it using 
    [az account](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli).

    ```python
    from azure.common.client_factory import get_client_from_cli_profile
    from azure.mgmt.compute import ComputeManagementClient

    client = get_client_from_cli_profile(ComputeManagementClient)
    ```
