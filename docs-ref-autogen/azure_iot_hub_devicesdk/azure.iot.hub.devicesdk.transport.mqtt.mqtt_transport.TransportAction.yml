  summary: 'base class representing various actions that can be taken

    when the transport is connected.  When the MqttTransport user

    calls a function that requires the transport to be connected,

    a TransportAction object is created and added to the action

    queue.  Then, when the transport is actually connected, it

    loops through the objects in the action queue and executes them

    one by one.'
