    - description: 'Required. The ARM resource identifier of the virtual

        network subnet which nodes running tasks from the job will join for the

        duration of the task. This is only supported for jobs running on

        VirtualMachineConfiguration pools. This is of the form

        /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

        The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the

        Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

        addresses to accommodate the number of nodes which will run tasks from the

        job. For more details, see
