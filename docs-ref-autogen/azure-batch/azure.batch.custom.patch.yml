  summary: 'Adds a collection of tasks to the specified job.


    Note that each task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not

    return the results for each task in the same order the tasks were

    submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is

    closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully

    processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the

    request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures

    when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task

    IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry

    will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any

    tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry,

    it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to

    omit tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The

    maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 7 days. If a

    task has not completed within 7 days of being added it will be

    terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at

    that time.
